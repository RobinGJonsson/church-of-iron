# UX

### Color Scheme

I used Mycolor.space as inspiration for the site's colors.
![Color theme](docs/color-scheme.png)

[Back to top](#church-of-iron)

## Agile Project Management

I used GitHub Agile project management tool to create user stories using issues and planned the user stories into three different stages using Kanban board with three columns that are `To do`, `In progress` and `Done`. The user stories are labeled with **MoSCoW** techniques to prioritize the projectâ€™s tasks.

### Database ERD

I used `Lucidchart` to create the project's database schema models which helps me to unserstand the relationship between the models. Heroku Postgres database and the SQLite are used for the project.

![ERD]()

#### Models

-   **Django user** - Is the Django built-inThe user model.
-   **UserProfile** - Is used for user information and membership status.
-   **Product** - Is used for the product information.
-   **Catagory** - Is used for the category of the products.
-   **Gym** - Is used for storing information about the a gym.
-   **OrderItem** - Is used for combining the product with the order.
-   **Order** - Is used for the order placed by the user when processing online purchase.
-   **Membership** - Is used for storing information about memberships.
-   **Amenity** - Is used for combining amenities with gyms.
-   **GymImage** - Is used for linking images to gyms.

### Business Model

The Church of Iron application is a B2C business model that it does the business directly with the end customer. Add items to the cart or signing up for a membership, complete the order, make a payment through secured payment system.

-   #### Marketing

    Church of Iron has a Facebook page for reaching all the customers instantly. The shop owner is able to post any updates or promotions to gather sales. The Facebook page provides a great effective way of communicating with shoppers.

    I created the `Church of Iron Facebook page`. However as it's not a real business page, I made a screenshot of the Facebook page and deleted it afterwards in order to avoid any problems under Facebook's rules. The Facebook link in the footer opens the link to Facebook but not the actual `Church of Iron Facebook page`. Here is the one but deleted page.

    ![Church of Iron Facebook page](docs/screencapture-facebook-profile.png)

-   #### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

    I added two meta tags with names of keywords and description on the page head, I made sure to use as much semantic HTML as possible, alt attributes to images, and I generated robots.txt and sitemap.xml to allow Google and search engines bot crawling.

-   #### Mailchimp newsletter subscription

    Church of Iron sends out regular newsletters and user can subscribe using email address. This is a great way for store owner to reach out existing and potential customers with any updates or promotions.

    ![Newsletter](docs/mailchimp.png)

## Store Page

The store page contains all the products, the different categories are currently reached through the navbar. There are currently only 1 product for each category that is repeated. This is because I couldn't find any dummy data for fitness products and I couldn't waste any more time finding it as I think the point of the page is to display the possibilty of acctual products.
